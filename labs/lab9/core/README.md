# [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/README.md): [Labs](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/README.md)

## [Lab 9: Binary Heaps & Priority Queues](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab9/README.md) ([Core](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab9/core/README.md))
```shell
python labs 9
```

This lab has 6 core exercises, though most (particularly the later ones) need few lines to complete.

In the first we implement heap sort, in the second a more general binary heap, and the remaining four are all
implementations of the priority queue interface.

1. [Heap Sort](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab9/core/heap_sort/README.md)
2. [Binary Heaps](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab9/core/binary_heap/README.md)
3. [Unsorted List Priority Queues](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab9/core/unsorted_list_priority_queue/README.md)
4. [Sorted List Priority Queues](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab9/core/sorted_list_priority_queue/README.md)
5. [AVL Tree Priority Queues](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab9/core/avl_tree_priority_queue/README.md)
6. [Binary Heap Priority Queues](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab9/core/binary_heap_priority_queue/README.md)
