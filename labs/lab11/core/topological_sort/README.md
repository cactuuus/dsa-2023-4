### [Topological Sort](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab11/core/topological_sort/README.md)
```shell
python labs topological_sort
```

This exercise, in which we implement topological sorting of graphs' vertices, should - providing you successfully
implemented DFS - be trivial.

If you're not sure why, you'll find it worthwhile to go back over the lecture slides!

The only difference is really that we're going to return an iterator rather than an array/list.

Good luck! (As a hint, you should be able to implement the function in a line or two - if you're writing more than that,
you're probably doing something wrong!)
