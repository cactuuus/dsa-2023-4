# [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/README.md): [Labs](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/README.md)

## [Lab 8: AVL Trees](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab8/README.md) ([Plus](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab8/plus/README.md))
```shell
python labs 8+
```

There aren't any plus exercises for this lab, but basically you might use an AVL tree anywhere you might use a map!

(Admittedly, hash maps are probably more commonly-used, but an advantage of AVL trees - and BSTs more generally - over
hash maps is that they're _ordered_ maps, so if e.g. efficient sorted iteration matters to you, then they're the better
choice.)
