# [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/README.md): [Labs](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/README.md)

## [Lab 4: Sorting & Array Maps](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab4/README.md) ([Core](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab4/core/README.md))
```shell
python labs 4
```

These core exercises start with a few sorting algorithms. They then move on to binary search, both because of its
utility as an algorithm in its own right and as a warm-up for the final two exercises, which are to implement the map
interface using arrays in two different ways (which themselves are useful to do ahead of next week, when we will
implement another type of map).

1. [Selection Sort](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab4/core/selection_sort/README.md)
2. [Insertion Sort](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab4/core/insertion_sort/README.md)
3. [Merge Sort](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab4/core/merge_sort/README.md)
4. [Binary Search](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab4/core/binary_search/README.md)
5. [Unsorted Array Maps](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab4/core/unsorted_array_map/README.md)
6. [Sorted Array Maps](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab4/core/sorted_array_map/README.md)
