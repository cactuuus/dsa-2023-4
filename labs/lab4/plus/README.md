# [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/README.md): [Labs](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/README.md)

## [Lab 4: Sorting & Array Maps](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab4/README.md) ([Plus](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab4/plus/README.md))
```shell
python labs 4+
```

In this lab, like in lab 2, the plus exercises aren't really exercises, as their implementations are already complete.
They're instead simple usage examples, to give you some idea of how maps are used. They are very much not the only ways
in which they're used: maps, like lists, are very useful in all sorts of contexts - nearly all programmers used them
frequently, across a wide range of applications.
