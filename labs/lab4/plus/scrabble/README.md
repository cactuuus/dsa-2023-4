### [Scrabble](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab4/plus/scrabble/README.md)
```shell
python labs scrabble
```

This example is a simple tool for calculating the number of points a given word is worth in the board game
[Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble).

It stores the letter values in a map, which it then looks them up in.

There's not much to the code, and hopefully it should be self-explanatory, but it's an example of how maps can be used
to associate data with other data - in this case, letters with numbers of points.
