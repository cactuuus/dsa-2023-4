# [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/README.md): [Labs](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/README.md)

## [Lab 5: Hash Maps](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab5/README.md) ([Plus](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab5/plus/README.md))
```shell
python labs 5+
```

This lab's plus exercises are again examples rather than "proper" exercises, but are quite a bit more involved/complex.
You might find them a bit much, and if you can't understand them then don't worry! Most of their content is very much
outside the scope of this module. _However,_ you may also find them particularly interesting/enjoyable - have a look and
see!
