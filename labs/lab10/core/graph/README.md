### [Graphs](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab10/graph/README.md)
```shell
python labs graph
```

We're first going to implement a static graph type, using the adjacency list approach described in the lectures.

The methods that you're to do are:

1. `vertices`
2. `edges`
3. `get_edge`
4. `degree`
5. `neighbours` (`adj` in the lectures)

Note that the initialisation is done for you, meaning that the main map already contains the graph's information, so
implementing these methods is just a case of using the appropriate methods of the map to get the relevant data out.

Good luck!
