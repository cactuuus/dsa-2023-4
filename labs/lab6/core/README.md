# [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/README.md): [Labs](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/README.md)

## [Lab 6: Binary Trees & Traversals](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab6/README.md) ([Core](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab6/core/README.md))
```shell
python labs 6
```

There's only one core exercise this lab! You may worry that it's therefore absolutely fiendish, but it's actually not
too bad. It involves implementing quite a few functions, but as functions we ask you to implement go, they're not overly
hard. This may well mean you end up finishing it in much less time than the number of hours you're supposed to be
spending on these labs. If you do end up in that happy situation, you'll likely be even happier to be reminded that
there are optional plus exercises to stop you twiddling your thumbs while you wait for next week's. (Actually, this
lab's plus exercises haven't been released _quite_ yet, but they'll appear in the next few days. Fear not: You should do
this core exercise first anyway, and - if you didn't at the time - there are previous weeks' plus content to go back to
and catch up on.)
