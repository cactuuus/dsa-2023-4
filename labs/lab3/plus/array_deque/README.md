# [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/README.md): [Labs](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/README.md)

## [Lab 3: More Lists, Stacks & Queues](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab3/README.md) ([Core](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab3/core/README.md))

### [Array Deques](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab3/core/array_deque/README.md)
```shell
python labs array_deque
```

There's not much to say for this exercise that wasn't said in the previous one(s): The task is to again implement a
deque, but this time using a `CircularDynamicArrayList`. You should - hopefully - find this very straightforward at this
point!
