# [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/README.md): [Labs](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/README.md)

## [Lab 3: More Lists, Stacks & Queues](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab3/README.md) ([Core](https://github.com/bertie-wheen/dsa-2023-4/blob/trunk/labs/lab3/core/README.md))
```shell
python labs 3
```

The first two exercises build on the static array lists exercise in the previous lab, so hopefully you managed that one.
If not, you should first have a look at the now-published solution. (You should also look at solutions regardless of how
you found the exercises, but especially so in this case.) These exercises are somewhat different to that one, but not
entirely dissimilar, in that they hold a backing array, sometimes reallocate it, and when they do allocate a new one
they then fill it by copying the items across from the old one.

The remaining four core exercises, which implement stacks and queues in two ways each, are, as already mentioned, very
simple. As a result, these core exercises are very front-heavy, so still "only" being on the first or second exercise a
few hours in isn't cause for despair, but is actually expected, as the last four should be very quick to complete.
